# FSL Resource Calendar

This calendar allows you to view service appointments in your org.

You can filter by [Work Type](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_worktype.htm), [Service Resource](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_serviceresource.htm), [Service Appointment Status](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_serviceappointment.htm) and even search appointments!

Or you can use all filters at once! (see screenshots below)

You can even use this without the need for a "Dispatcher License".
